I have been always curious on Chrome Extensions, and I miss a way to create small extensions as simple a [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).

Thatâ€™s why I have released a really simple skeleton of a Chrome extension, that includes a minified jQuery, a javascript file that will be executed when the DOM is loaded, and some instructions on how to install it. Find it in [ferblape / kinda-greasemonkey-chrome-extension](https://github.com/ferblape/kinda-greasemonkey-chrome-extension).
