[A few thoughts about Open Source Software - Antirez weblog](http://antirez.com/news/48)  

> You can see all this from a different point of view, but what I see is that a lot of value in the current IT industry is provided by open source software, often written in the spare time, or with important efforts filling the time gaps between one thing and another thing you do in your work time, if your employer is kind enough to allow you to do so.

> What I think is that this is economically suboptimal, a lot of smart coders could provide an economical boost if they could be more free to write what they love and what a lot of people are probably already using to make money.
