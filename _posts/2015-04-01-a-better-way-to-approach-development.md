> Planning and estimation are too often confused. One is good, the other, not so much. Here is why.

From [https://storify.com/deadprogram/a-better-way-to-approach-development](https://storify.com/deadprogram/a-better-way-to-approach-development)

Two of my favourite quotes:

> 8/Startups you should not be asking “how much and how long?”. Ask “how would you advise we spend X dollars?”
> 
> 10/Consultancies don’t answer “how much and how long?”. Ask “What is X, so we can give you good advice on how to use it?”
