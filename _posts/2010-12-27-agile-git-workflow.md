Overview:

1. Branch off of master to work on the feature
2. Work, work, work, commit, commit, commit
3. Pull down any updates to master
4. Rebase and squash (with discretion) the feature branch to masterâ€™s&nbsp;HEAD
5. Merge the feature branch back to master
6. Push up to the shared repository

Git commands:

{% highlight python %}
...
git commit -m "Feature finished"
git fetch
git rebase -i -p origin/master
# pick vs. squash commits
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff issue-12
{% endhighlight %}
