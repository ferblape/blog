> Swift is just a better hammer. It doesn’t represent a new class of tools. It doesn’t reshape the way we think about programming as a whole or even an area of programming, as we should expect from a new tool developed by such a powerful industry leader.
> 
> Sadly, Apple isn’t the only would-be world-changer to leave us cold. Facebook and Google’s Hack and Go are also just better hammers. And people love having better hammers for their nails. But as long as the expectations of our industry remain this low, a paradigm shift is not likely to occur.
>
