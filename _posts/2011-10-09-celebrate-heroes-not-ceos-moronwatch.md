[Celebrate Heroes, Not CEOs « MoronWatch](http://moronwatch.net/2011/10/celebrate-heroes-not-ceos.html)  

> Heroes still exist – they always have done. It’s just that the mass media would rather we didn’t know about them. Instead, they give us corporate heroes, CEOs, men who change the world – but not necessarily for the better. We need to be more selective about who we hero-worship. The power to write real heroes back into history is in our hands.
