Do you know [mustachio](https://github.com/afeld/mustachio)? Itâ€™s the kind of projects that makes you smile. It tries to add a mustache to the people appearing in a photo. For example, this is me:

I have created a bookmarklet that you can drop in your bookmarks bar that adds the mustache to a photo that you are visiting: [mustache!](javascript:void((function()%7Bwindow.location.href='http://mustachio.heroku.com/?src='%20+%20window.location.href;%7D)());). Enjoy!
