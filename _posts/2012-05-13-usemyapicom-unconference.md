Yesterday we enjoyed a really nice unconference about APIâ€™s develpment and usage, and good practices, [usemyapi.com](http://usemyapi.com), organized by the amazing guys from [ASP Gems](http://aspgems.com/en).

You can review some of the topics by searching in twitter with the hashtag [#usemyapi](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23usemyapi).

I prepared a talk about [Event Oriented APIs](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/659167/usemyapi%20-%20fernando%20blat.pdf) and a [small demo page](http://instagram-realtime-demo.herokuapp.com) (you can [get the code from Github](https://github.com/ferblape/instagram-realtime-demo)).

It was really interesting to hear about the problems that developers have to deal when design and use APIs, how this process has changed during the years and their experiences implementing them.
