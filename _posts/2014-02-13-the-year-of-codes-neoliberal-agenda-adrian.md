[The Year of Code's neoliberal agenda - Adrian Short](http://adrianshort.org/2014/02/06/year-of-code-neoliberal-agenda/)  

> So my concern isn’t so much that the Year of Code is just another trojan horse for sneaking politics into schools, but that it’s nasty politics: the politics of work-or-starve, of having a boss or being a boss, of hierarchy and inequality, of private affluence and public squalour, of the kind of self-satisfied meritocracy that consigns those deemed unmeritorious to miserable lives, public ridicule and early deaths. Code to get by very soon becomes code or die. If that sounds like hyperbole, get away from the keyboard more.

> I’m certainly not going to argue against learning to program or against teaching coding in schools. You should learn to program, and whole lot of other things, as your life really does depend on it. But it shouldn’t do, and we should be rightly suspicious when projects like the Year of Code are run by and clearly for the benefit of the usual tax-cutting, deregulating, society-shrinking corporate interests. It might be happening in a classroom but it’s not education.
