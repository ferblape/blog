Using Mountain Lion and [wkhtmltopdf](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/) installed via homebrew, when I run my tests they stop when inside the test it generates a PDF, and I couldnâ€™t finish the execution of all the suite. I use also [pdfkit gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/pdfkit).

After searching a lot no one seems to have this problem. I fixed it by removing the package from homebrew and installing it manually, [downloading the binary](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/downloads/list) from the project webpage.
