_(notes taken from this great talk)_

[Sandi Metz talks about SOLID Object-Oriented Design](http://confreaks.net/videos/240-goruco2009-solid-object-oriented-design)

Your application will change, and what will happen when it changes depends on itâ€™s design, because you are going to be introducing unexpected dependencies, and only a good design can help you to keep your code good enough.

If you plan your application to fail, skip design, but if your application succeeds it will cost you money.

SOLID:

- **S** ingle Responsibility
- **O** pen / Closed
- **L** iskov Substitution&nbsp;(not very common in AR objects)
- **I** nterface Segregation&nbsp;(does not apply to dynamic languages)
- **D** epenency Inversion&nbsp;

Design is all about dependencies: if you refer to something, you depend to it; and when the things you depende on change, you must change.

Red - Green - Refactor:

- Is it DRY?
- Does it have one responsibility?
- Does everything in it change at the same rate?
- Does it depend on things that change less often that it does?
