> Einstein famously postulated that, as Dr. White put it, “thou shalt not exceed the speed of light,” essentially setting a galactic speed limit. But in 1994, a Mexican physicist,&nbsp;[Miguel Alcubierre](https://twitter.com/malcubierre),&nbsp;[theorized that faster-than-light speeds were possible](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:1yGEsIzMCJAJ:www.if.ufrj.br/~mbr/warp/alcubierre/cq940501.pdf+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a "Paper (cached)")&nbsp;in a way that did not contradict Einstein, though Dr. Alcubierre did not suggest anyone could actually construct the engine that could accomplish that.

> His theory involved harnessing the expansion and contraction of space itself. Under Dr.[Alcubierre’s hypothesis](http://www.andersoninstitute.com/alcubierre-warp-drive.html "An explanation of the hypothesis"), a ship still couldn’t exceed light speed in a local region of space. But a theoretical propulsion system he sketched out manipulated&nbsp;[space-time](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/557482/space-time)&nbsp;by generating a so-called “warp bubble” that would expand space on one side of a spacecraft and contract it on another.
