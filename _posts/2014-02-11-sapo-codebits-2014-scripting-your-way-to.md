[SAPO Codebits 2014 - SCRIPTING YOUR WAY TO (IM)MORTALITY](https://codebits.eu/intra/s/proposal/485)  

> Every single provider of a digital service and a massive increasing number of users will need a deceased policy in the near future. It’s not easy to accept, but there are _very high_ probabilities all the people attending this talk will be dead at some point.

> In this talk, I’ll reflect in the consequences of this universal fact and what it means for developers the two more usual reactions: acceptance (digital legacies, current policies of different services, digital executors…) and denial (options of pseudo-afterlife with bots, long term thinking for services & providers…). I’ll primarily focus in the situation and possibilities provided by the actual technological landscape (no science-fiction AIs, sorry) and explain the in-progress initiatives on this area.
> 
> As software eats the world and changes our lives creating new experiences, we’ll need to find digital metaphors and practices to accommodate one of the processes that has been with us since the dawn of time: death.
